    "Итоговое качество модели Берт оказались выше (98% против 96% у модели классического машинного обучения на тестовых выборках), однако нужно отметить несопоставимую разницу в скорости обучения и скорость работы в целом. Класическое решение учится в разы быстрее и незначительно хуже результат, потому для конкретно этой задачи лучше использовать классический подход, если бы для заказчика полученный уровень качества оказался бы достаточным. Хотя если бы расчёты производились бы на cuda, то обучение нейронной сети прошло быстрее, но опять же это ресурсы, которых может и не быть. С другой стороны, для классического машинного обучения понадобилось больше подготовительных действий: очитска и обработка датасета, в то время как нейронной сети мы просто отдали размеченный датасет."

    "По итогу получилась небольшая мешанина, так даже немного веселее. Дело в том, что выборка новостей с тегами устарела, теперь в сайте BBC немного другие разделы, я собрал по 5 новостей из каждого раздела, отметил реальными тегами, к которым они относятся и соотнём их с 5ю предсказанными. К сожалению Я не могу выдать вероятность модели, так как совершил небольшую ошибку, закодировав классы через label encoder. наверное если бы кодировать через one hot получился бы массив с 5ю метками и получилось бы лучше, в плане оценки вероятности. Если будет время, постараюсь исправить. Тем не менее получилось достаточно интересно и всё таки глядя на актуальные метки и то как модели справились с классификацией, наверное стоит отметить DistilBert, как модель которая справилась значительно лучше."
